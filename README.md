I spotted a listing on Facebook's site in the area of "integrity", and got curious what that meant.  The code here includes a little scraper to collect all the listings from facebook.com/careers with the term 'integrity', and some exploratory data analysis in a Jupyter notebook.

This was fun but not hugely more informative than skimming all the job listings.  Beyond that, this isn't the place for writing a thinkpiece, so I'll leave it with the code.
